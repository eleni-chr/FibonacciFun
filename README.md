# FibonacciFun
Various functions relating to the Fibonacci series

## Functions

1. *fibonacci*: The function returns the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence, as specified by the input.

2. *fibonacci_closed*: The function returns the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence, as specified by the input.

3. *fibor*: This is a recursive function that computes the first n elements of the Fibonacci series where n is the sole input argument.

4. *fibo_trace*: This function takes a scalar n as input, and returns a scalar f as output, indicating the nth element in the Fibonacci series. It also takes an empty vector called trace as an input argument and returns the vector with an array of numbers corresponding to the input arguments of the recursive function calls in the order they were made.
